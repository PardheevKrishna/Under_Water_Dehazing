# Under_Water_Dehazing

## Digital Image Processing Research Project

This repository contains the files and documentation for the research project titled "Under_Water_Dehazing," 

# Pardheev Krishna Tammineni (21BCE1406).

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm for dehazing underwater images. Underwater images often suffer from poor visibility due to the scattering of light by water particles. Dehazing algorithms aim to recover the original scene by removing the haze and improving the clarity of the image.

## Repository Contents

* **Word document:** The research paper is written in IEEE double-column format.
* **Reference papers:** A collection of PDF files containing relevant research papers on underwater dehazing.
* **Datasets:** The datasets used to train and evaluate the proposed algorithm.
* **readme.md:** This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.

## Future Work

Any subsequent development or application of the proposed algorithm will be documented and updated within this repository.
